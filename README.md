# Backstory
Havio was inspired by popular food mods like ["Vanilla Cookbook"](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanillacookbook) and ["Farmer's Delight"](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-fabric).

I decided to **remake** **Havio's Cookbook** with fresh new content, features, and compatibility with newer Minecraft versions. This **Reborn** version brings exciting updates and enhancements to your Minecraft world!
